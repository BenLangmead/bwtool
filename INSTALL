bwtool installation instructions
================================
Hopefully all that there is to do is to execute the following:

   $ ./configure 
   $ make 
   $ sudo make install

Sometimes of course root access isn't possible. Sometimes libraries
required are in non-standard directories.  At the minimum, bwtool
requires the pthread, math (libm), and zlib libraries. These are 
quite standard on linux computers or Mac computers with the developer
kit and the command-line tools installed.

If there is a library that cannot be found automatically by the
configure script, the way to add them is to do this:

   $ ./configure LDFLAGS="-L<path to dir containing library>"

but note that it may also be necessary to add the location of the
header files for that library.  In this case add:

   CFLAGS="-I<path to dir containing header files>"

in addition to the LDFLAGS as above.  Finally, it's common to work
on a computer without root access.  In this case, "make install" 
will probably not work because it will try to install bwtool
in a system directory such as /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin.  In this
case, use the --prefix option for configure to choose a directory
which can be written to, e.g.

   $ ./configure --prefix=$HOME
